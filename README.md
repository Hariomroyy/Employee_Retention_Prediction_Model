# 🏢 Employee Retention Predictor  

This project predicts whether an employee is likely to **stay or leave a company** based on their profile information. It combines a **machine learning model** trained in a Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) with an interactive **Streamlit web application (`app.py`)**.  

The model uses HR-related features like education, company size, experience, and more, and provides a simple web UI for prediction.
